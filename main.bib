	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long promised to increase healthcare affordability, quality and accessibility but FDA, until recently, had never authorized an autonomous AI diagnostic system. This pivotal trial of an AI system to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) in people with diabetes enrolled 900 subjects, with no history of DR at primary care clinics, by comparing to Wisconsin Fundus Photograph Reading Center (FPRC) widefield stereoscopic photography and macular Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), by FPRC certified photographers, and FPRC grading of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Severity Scale (ETDRS) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). More than mild DR (mtmDR) was defined as ETDRS level 35 or higher, and/or DME, in at least one eye. AI system operators underwent a standardized training protocol before study start. Median age was 59 years (range, 22–84 years); among participants, 47.5\% of participants were male; 16.1\% were Hispanic, 83.3\% not Hispanic; 28.6\% African American and 63.4\% were not; 198 (23.8\%) had mtmDR. The AI system exceeded all pre-specified superiority endpoints at sensitivity of 87.2\% (95\% CI, 81.8–91.2\%) ({\textgreater}85\%), specificity of 90.7\% (95\% CI, 88.3–92.7\%) ({\textgreater}82.5\%), and imageability rate of 96.1\% (95\% CI, 94.6–97.3\%), demonstrating AI’s ability to bring specialty-level diagnostics to primary care settings. Based on these results, FDA authorized the system for use by health care providers to detect more than mild DR and diabetic macular edema, making it, the first FDA authorized autonomous AI diagnostic system in any field of medicine, with the potential to help prevent vision loss in thousands of people with diabetes annually.

We used the previously reported consensus reference standard of referable DR (rDR), defined as International Clinical Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy moderate, severe nonproliferative (NPDR), proliferative DR, and/or macular edema (ME). Neither Messidor-2 images, nor the three retinal specialists setting the Messidor-2 reference standard were used for training IDx-DR version X2.1. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, area under the curve (AUC), and their confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.    Sensitivity was 96.8\% (95\% CI: 93.3\%–98.8\%), specificity was 87.0\% (95\% CI: 84.2\%–89.4\%), with 6/874 false negatives, resulting in a negative predictive value of 99.0\% (95\% CI: 97.8\%–99.6\%). No cases of severe NPDR, PDR, or ME were missed. The AUC was 0.980 (95\% CI: 0.968–0.992). Sensitivity was not statistically different from published IDP sensitivity, which had a CI of 94.4\% to 99.3\%, but specificity was significantly better than the published IDP specificity CI of 55.7\% to 63.0\%.    A deep-learning enhanced algorithm for the automated detection of DR, achieves significantly better performance than a previously reported, otherwise essentially identical, algorithm that does not employ deep learning. Deep learning enhanced algorithms have the potential to improve the efficiency of DR screening, and thereby to prevent visual loss and blindness from this devastating disease.},

The manual counting of white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) in microscopic images is an extremely tedious, time consuming, and inaccurate process. Automatic analysis will allow hematologist experts to perform faster and more accurately. The proposed method uses an iterative structured circle detection algorithm for the segmentation and counting of WBCs and RBCs. The separation of WBCs from RBCs was achieved by thresholding, and specific preprocessing steps were developed for each cell type. Counting was performed for each image using the proposed method based on modified circle detection, which automatically counted the cells. Several modifications were made to the basic (RCD) algorithm to solve the initialization problem, detecting irregular circles (cells), selecting the optimal circle from the candidate circles, determining the number of iterations in a fully dynamic way to enhance algorithm detection, and running time. The validation method used to determine segmentation accuracy was a quantitative analysis that included Precision, Recall, and F-measurement tests. The average accuracy of the proposed method was 95.3\% for RBCs and 98.4\% for WBCs.},

	abstract = {Introduction There are automated systems for digital peripheral blood (PB) cell analysis, but they operate most effectively in nonpathological blood samples. The objective of this work was to design a methodology to improve the automatic classification of abnormal lymphoid cells. Methods We analyzed 340 digital images of individual lymphoid cells from PB films obtained in the CellaVision DM96:150 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, 100 hairy cell leukemia (HCL) cells, and 90 normal lymphocytes (N). We implemented the Watershed Transformation to segment the nucleus, the cytoplasm, and the peripheral cell region. We extracted 44 features and then the clustering Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) was applied in two steps for the lymphocyte classification. Results The images were automatically clustered in three groups, one of them with 98\% of the HCL cells. The set of the remaining cells was clustered again using FCM and texture features. The two new groups contained 83.3\% of the N cells and 71.3\% of the CLL cells, respectively. Conclusion The approach has been able to automatically classify with high precision three types of lymphoid cells. The addition of more descriptors and other classification techniques will allow extending the classification to other classes of atypical lymphoid cells.},

	doi = {10.1309/AJCP78IFSTOGZZJN},
	abstract = {Objectives: The objective was the development of a method for the automatic recognition of different types of atypical lymphoid cells. Methods: In the method development, a training set (TS) of 1,500 lymphoid cell images from peripheral blood was used. To segment the images, we used clustering of color components and watershed transformation. In total, 113 features were extracted for lymphocyte recognition by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with a 10-fold cross-validation over the TS. Then, a new validation set (VS) of 150 images was used, performing two steps: (1) tuning the LDA classifier using the TS and (2) classifying the VS in the different lymphoid cell types. Results: The segmentation algorithm was very effective in separating the cytoplasm, nucleus, and peripheral zone around the cell. From them, descriptive features were extracted and used to recognize the different lymphoid cells. The accuracy for the classification in the TS was 98.07\%. The precision, sensitivity, and specificity values were above 99.7\%, 97.5\%, and 98.6\%, respectively. The accuracy of the classification in the VS was 85.33\%. Conclusions: The method reaches a high precision in the recognition of five different types of lymphoid cells and could allow for the design of a diagnosis support tool in the future. © American Society for Clinical Pathology.},
