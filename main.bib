	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most powerful technique for a range of different tasks in computer vision. Recent work suggested that CNN features are generic and can be used for classification tasks outside the exact domain for which the networks were trained. In this work we use the features from one such network, OverFeat, trained for object detection in natural images, for nodule detection in computed tomography scans. We use 865 scans from the publicly available LIDC data set, read by four thoracic radiologists. Nodule candidates are generated by a state-of-the-art nodule detection system. We extract 2D sagittal, coronal and axial patches for each nodule candidate and extract 4096 features from the penultimate layer of OverFeat and classify these with linear support vector machines. We show for various configurations that the off-the-shelf CNN features perform surprisingly well, but not as good as the dedicated detection system. When both approaches are combined, significantly better results are obtained than either approach alone. We conclude that CNN features have great potential to be used for detection tasks in volumetric medical data.},

Our algorithm, CheXNet, is a 121-layer convolutional neural network trained on ChestX-ray14, currently the largest publicly available chest X-ray dataset, containing over 100,000 frontal-view X-ray images with 14 diseases. Four practicing academic radiologists annotate a test set, on which we compare the performance of CheXNet to that of radiologists. We find that CheXNet exceeds average radiologist performance on the F1 metric. We extend CheXNet to detect all 14 diseases in ChestX-ray14 and achieve state of the art results on all 14 diseases.},

Traditionally, problem dependent handcrafted features are used to represent the content of images. An alternative approach successfully applied in other domains is the use of neural networks to automatically discover good features. This work presents an evaluation of convolutional neural networks to learn features for mammography mass lesions before feeding them to a classification stage. Experimental results showed that this approach is a suitable strategy outperforming the state-of-the-art representation from 79.9\% to 86\% in terms of area under the ROC curve.},

	abstract = {Quick and accurate medical diagnoses are crucial for the successful treatment of diseases. Using machine learning algorithms and based on laboratory blood test results, we have built two models to predict a haematologic disease. One predictive model used all the available blood test parameters and the other used only a reduced set that is usually measured upon patient admittance. Both models produced good results, obtaining prediction accuracies of 0.88 and 0.86 when considering the list of five most likely diseases and 0.59 and 0.57 when considering only the most likely disease. The models did not differ significantly, which indicates that a reduced set of parameters can represent a relevant “fingerprint” of a disease. This knowledge expands the model’s utility for use by general practitioners and indicates that blood test results contain more information than physicians generally recognize. A clinical test showed that the accuracy of our predictive models was on par with that of haematology specialists. Our study is the first to show that a machine learning predictive model based on blood tests alone can be successfully applied to predict haematologic diseases. This result and could open up unprecedented possibilities for medical diagnosis.},

	abstract = {The future of clinical diagnosis and treatment of hematologic diseases will inevitably involve the integration of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems into routine practice to support the hematologists' decision making. Several studies have shown that AI-based models can already be used to automatically differentiate cells, reliably detect malignant cell populations, support chromosome banding analysis, and interpret clinical variants, contributing to early disease detection and prognosis. However, even the best tool can become useless if it is misapplied or the results are misinterpreted. Therefore, in order to comprehensively judge and correctly apply newly developed AI-based systems, the hematologist must have a basic understanding of the general concepts of machine learning. In this review, we provide the hematologist with a comprehensive overview of various machine learning techniques, their current implementations and approaches in different diagnostic subfields (e.g., cytogenetics, molecular genetics), and the limitations and unresolved challenges of the systems.},
